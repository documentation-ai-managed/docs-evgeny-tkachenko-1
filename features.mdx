## Document Organization and Hierarchy

Build a clear structure for your documentation using folders and subpages. You create nested hierarchies to mirror your project's architecture, making navigation intuitive.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Start by adding top-level folders for major sections like "API Reference" or "User Guides".

    ```bash
    # Example CLI command (if using integrations)
    docs create-folder "API Reference"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Nest pages under folders. Use drag-and-drop for reorganization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Hierarchy" icon="globe">
    Your sidebar automatically reflects the structure for easy browsing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like "v1.0-api" for versions within folders.
</Callout>

## Version Control and History Tracking

Every edit creates a versioned snapshot. You review changes, compare diffs, and restore previous states without losing work.

<CodeGroup tabs="Web UI,CLI">
  ```javascript
  // View history via API
  const history = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/{docId}/history');
  console.log(history.entries);
  ```
  ```bash
  # CLI history command
  docs history --doc-id your-doc-id --limit 10
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Search and Filtering Tools

Powerful search scans titles, content, and metadata. Filter by tags, authors, or dates to pinpoint information quickly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Search" icon="search">
    Enter keywords in the global search bar. Results appear instantly with previews.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Filters" icon="filter">
    Combine filters:

    | Filter Type | Example Usage |
    |-------------|---------------|
    | Tags       | `tag:api`    |
    | Date Range | `after:2024-01-01` |
    | Author     | `author:you` |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
  Use operators like `AND`, `OR`, and quotes for phrases: `"exact match" tag:internal`.
</Expandable>

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Invite team members with role-based permissions. Share public links or embed docs externally.

    C -- No --> E[View Only]
    D --> F[Real-time Sync]
    E --> G[Comment & Suggest]
    F --> H[Version History]
